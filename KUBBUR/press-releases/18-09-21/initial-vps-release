# The Services

As of today, the 18th of Septemeber, 2021, we (KVM Group t/a KUBBUR) have released our longly-awaited VPS lineup of services available in Germany and London. These instances run AMD's Ryzen 3rd and 5th generation Ryzen 9 processing chips with a minimum of 12 and maximum of 16 cores per main node, making the instances as fast currently available. 

All VPS current locations (Germany and the UK) are equipped with the highest-tier DDoS Protection from Path Networks, Inc. or Combahton Gmbh ensuring stability and completely redundancy on every service.

The largest difference between our VPS offerings and the standard market is our custom-made VPS management panel integrated seamlessly into our billing and homepage. The panel comes with full instant Firewall-Management, VNC console sessions, audit-logging and one-click reinstalls (more to come Q4 2021!). 

The services are priced as follows:

1-GB-KVM: €5/mo
2-GB-KVM: €6/mo
3-GB-KVM: €9/mo
4-GB-KVM: €12/mo
... up to 32GB and further!

# The Future

From Q4 2021 and onward the KVM Group has set its target on having a physical presence of VPS and Cloud offerings in every one of the 4-5 most populated continents, and with that improve the overall experience and capabilities of our services. In doing so; we also seek to bring our customers, old and new, fresh services in different pricepoints in every location possible.
