# The Services

As of today, the 18th of Septemeber, 2021, we (KVM Group t/a KUBBUR) have released our longly-awaited VPS lineup of services available in Germany and London. These instances run AMD's Ryzen 3rd and 5th generation Ryzen 9 processing chips with a minimum of 12 and maximum of 16 cores per main node, DDR4 memory up to 3600MHz clock speeds and NVMe SSDs, making the instances as fast currently available. 

All VPS current locations (Germany and the UK) are equipped with the highest-tier DDoS Protection from Path Networks, Inc. (https://path.net) or Combahton Gmbh (https://combahton.net) ensuring stability and completely redundancy on every service. Even better; every instance comes with unmetered (Fair Use) bandwidth through these networks.

The largest difference between our VPS offerings and the standard market is our custom-made VPS management panel integrated seamlessly into our billing and homepage. The panel comes with full instant Firewall-Management, VNC console sessions, audit-logging and one-click reinstalls (more to come Q4 2021!). Already planned features are: one-click installations for Pterodactyl which can manage Minecraft, Rust and other game servers, OpenVPN, WireGuard and Ghost; Seamless within-second scaling of instances and instant location migration.

The services are priced as follows:

1-GB-KVM: €5/mo
2-GB-KVM: €6/mo
3-GB-KVM: €9/mo
4-GB-KVM: €12/mo
... up to 32GB and further!

# The Locations

Currently these VPS offerings (Path.net / Combahton.net Protected Ryzen 9) are available in Frankfurt/Falkenstein, Germany and London, United Kingdom. In Frankfurt and Falkenstein as of 18/09/2021 we rent hardware from Hetzner Online GmbH (then proxied through Combahton or Path) and Combahton GmbH. On the other hand in the United Kingdom we have 2 fresh Ryzen 9 servers running through Path's UK location, and there VPS servers can be upgraded to 10Gbps (still Fair use) for a €15/mo additional fee, we hope to bring this to Germany within the next year.

# The Future

From Q4 2021 and onward the KVM Group has set its target on having a physical presence of VPS and Cloud offerings in every one of the 4-5 most populated continents, and with that improve the overall experience and capabilities of our services. In doing so; we also seek to bring our customers, old and new, fresh services in different pricepoints in every location possible.
