# Introduction

After reading the IPCC's latest **code red** climate report it's become quite apparent that taking action right away to eliminate the carbon footprint of the world is critically important if we want to stay & live here on earth. Although the situation is now severe that we have about a zero percent chance to keep the global temperature increase from reaching 1.5Â°c we can still make a significant impact on future temperature increases by completely eliminating all of our carbon output.
So, we the team at KUBBUR, are proud to announce that we have been operating since day one on nearly no carbon emissions. This has been achieved by partnering with our amazing provider Hetzner Online, GmbH. which themselves have commited to zero carbon emissions and only using renewable energy to power their datacentres.

Now, as KUBBUR expands we plan on keeping our carbon footprint at net-zero or lower. We hope to achieve this by finding alternative ways to host our game servers like using clean providers similar to Hetzner or choosing fully green datacentres for our owned hardware locations. For some of our upcoming projects we hope to use Icelandic locations for the vast amounts of clean energy the country has to offer along with the natural cooling capabilities the climate has to minimise power consumption.

# Will this affect my services?

The short answer is *no*, KUBBUR services will continue to run as normal since they are already, at this stage, deployed in carbon-neutral ways. However, future services may be affected by this; namely we'll be trying to move anything that isn't dependent on network latency to datacentres better suited for HPC & data storage like those in Iceland we mentioned above. Additionally you may start seeing more obscure and unknown locations in the future when ordering our products as they'll be more suited for the task at hand, both from an environmental standpoint and an operational one.

# What is your long-term plan?

In the long term KUBBUR will be finding more and more ways to completely eliminate carbon output. For example we already have plans for our first ever equipment hauling vehicles to be electric / hydrogen powered to facilitate the clean transit of servers and such. Another example is how we will only be using power efficient hardware for our operations in an attempt to use the limit electricity capacity clean energy naturally has as best as possible, wasting less on heat and more on the actual task of the machine.
