# Does KUBBUR Support Modded Servers?

The answer is simply yes, KUBBUR supports any form of Minecraft executable, therefore we support the classic modded cores such as **Forge** and **FabricMC**. 
If you need help starting a modded server, don't worry! Just follow this tutorial and if you need more help contact our support which is available 24/7 on workdays. :D

To create a modded server you'll need:

**(1) Forge or FabricMC (or any other Modpack executable):**
  (1.1) Download Forge Server: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/
  (1.2) Download Fabric Server: https://fabricmc.net/use/ (Make sure to install the .JAR Executable)
  (1.3) For 1.16 and over you have to set your server java version to Java 16 in your KUBBUR management interface: https://kubbur.com/account/servers.

**(2) Get a KUBBUR or any mod supported server:**
  (2.1) For Forge and Fabric on newer versions (1.12+) we recommend using 4GB+ on our Extreme plan (Use code "SMP" for 30% OFF!)
  (2.2) Buy an Extreme plan here: https://KUBBUR.com/minecraft/extreme

**(3) Install the modded jar on your server:**
  (3.1) Simply go to your server's management interface (such as https://panel.kubbur.com/) enter "File Management" and drop your Forge JAR in there. 
  (3.2) Set your startup JAR to the forge jar.
