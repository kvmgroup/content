# Does KUBBUR Support Modded Servers?

The answer is simply yes, KUBBUR supports any form of Minecraft executable, therefore we support the classic modded cores such as **Forge** and **FabricMC**. 
If you need help starting a modded server, don't worry! Just follow this tutorial and if you need more help contact our support which is available 24/7 on workdays. :D

To create a modded server you'll need:

**(1) Forge or FabricMC (or any other Modpack executable):
  - Download Forge Server: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/
  - Download Fabric Server: https://fabricmc.net/use/ (Make sure to install the .JAR Executable)

**(2) Get a KUBBUR or any mod supported server:
  - For Forge and Fabric on newer versions (1.12+) we recommend using 4GB+ on our Extreme plan (Use code "SMP" for 30% OFF!)
  - Other recommended hosts: https://reddit.com/admincraft/wiki/hosts
  - Buy an Extreme plan here: https://KUBBUR.com/minecraft/extreme

**(3) Install the modded jar on your server:
  - Simply go to your server's management interface (such as https://panel.kubbur.com/) enter "File Management" and drop your Forge JAR in there. 
  - Set your startup JAR to the forge jar.
