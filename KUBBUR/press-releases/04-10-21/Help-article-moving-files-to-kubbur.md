# How to move your old server files to KUBBUR

Lots of people are moving to KUBBUR from other hosting providers and they'd like their old server files, including their worlds and progress to stick with them, here's how we do it.

What you'll need to do:

**(1) Download your old server files to your PC:**
  - Most hosting companies use either Pterodactyl (including WISP) or Multicraft which both allow for easy file downloading, we will include tutorials for each.
  - On Pterodactyl and WISP: In your "File Manager" section, fill the checkbox by the /home/container/ directory so all folders and files are selected (their checkboxes get filled), then press the archive button which pops up when you fill the checkbox.
